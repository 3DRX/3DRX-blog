## Principles of network applications

**An application-layer protocol defines**:
- types of messages exchanged
- message syntax
- message semantics
- rules for when and how to send & response to messages

### Internet transport protocols services

**TCP**:
- reliable transport
- flow control
- congestion control
- connection-oriented

**UDP**:
- unreliable data transfer
- state-less

## Web and HTTP

## DNS

## P2P applications

## Video streaming and CDN

## Socket programming with TCP and UDP
